# Economy-Microservice

This service allows the user to initialize the amount of points/dollars/credits they start their program with, and it allows them
to modify that number using basic math functions. Your points are saved in a wallet.txt file for reference.

To initialize your points, call the initialize(int) function. Example:
initialize(5);

To modify your point total, use the economy (int, char) function. Example:
Economy(10, '+');
